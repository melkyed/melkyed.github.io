# Melkamu Gishu - Data Science Portfolio

[![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Site-View%20Portfolio-004b8d?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://melkyed.github.io)

This repository hosts the source code for my professional portfolio website. It is a static site built with **Jekyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**, designed to showcase my experience in Data Science, Applied Statistics, and ML Engineering.

## 🚀 About The Project

This portfolio was built from scratch to demonstrate clean, responsive web design principles without relying on heavy pre-made themes.

**Key Features:**
* **Architecture:** Modular Jekyll structure (Markdown content separated from HTML layouts).
* **Styling:** Custom CSS using CSS Grid and Flexbox for a responsive "Dashboard" layout.
* **CI/CD:** Automated deployment via GitHub Actions/Pages.
* **Navigation:** Responsive 2-row navigation bar with hover effects.
