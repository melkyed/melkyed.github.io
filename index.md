Welcome to my professional portfolio.

I am a Data Scientist holding a **MSc. in Applied Statistics** and a **BSc. in Applied Mathematics** with over 8 years of experience. I specialize in applying advanced quantitative and predictive modeling to solve complex problems across finance, healthcare, and education.

I manage the full data lifecycle: from the architectural groundwork of ETL, pipeline development, and cloud migration utilizing **Databricks-PySpark** and **SQL** to optimize enterprise data management to the final delivery of visualization.

My technical expertise extends to AI and research. I leverage a blend of statistical theory and technical fluency in **Python, R, and cloud tools** to drive measurable business value and innovation.
