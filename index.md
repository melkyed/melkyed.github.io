# Senior Data Scientist & Statistician

I am a quantitative expert with over **8 years of experience** bridging the gap between complex statistical theory and actionable business solutions. Holding an **MSc in Applied Statistics** and a **BSc in Applied Mathematics**, I specialize in building predictive models, optimizing cloud architectures, and driving innovation across finance, healthcare, and education.

Currently, I focus on the full data lifecycle—from architectural groundwork using **Databricks, PySpark, and Azure**, to advanced machine learning implementation and executive-level visualization.
