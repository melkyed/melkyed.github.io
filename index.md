# Hello, I’m Melkamu

I’m a Data Scientist with more than eight years of experience helping teams make better decisions with data. My work sits at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and cloud engineering. 

I enjoy taking messy data, shaping it into something useful, and turning it into insights that drive real results.

### What I focus on
- Predictive modeling and statistical analysis  
- Building scalable pipelines on Azure Databricks  
- ETL design and cloud migration  
- Machine learning in Python and R  
- Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling  

### What you’ll find here
A bit about me, selected publications, past work, and projects I’ve enjoyed building.
