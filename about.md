# About Me

I’m a Data Scientist with a strong background in Applied Statistics and Applied Mathematics. Over the years, I’ve helped organizations in finance, healthcare, and education use data in meaningful ways.

I manage the full data lifecycle. This includes shaping raw data through ETL, building pipelines, migrating systems to the cloud, creating predictive models, and developing visual products that help teams take action. 

My experience includes Databricks, PySpark, SQL, Azure, Python, R, and modern machine learning frameworks. I also have research experience in Bayesian modeling and global health, and I’ve authored several peer-reviewed publications.
